This is the code wrote for my semester 1 Programming Fundamentals course with C++. It is a Password generator and strength checking tool that gives passwords a strength ranking based on their split between alphabets, numbers, symbols, uppercase lowercase etc and also displays the justification of those ratings. It also generates a password of high strength based on user defined character limit.
